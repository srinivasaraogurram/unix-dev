By default, `sudo` asks for your password every time you use it to ensure that only authorized users can perform administrative tasks. However, if you want to avoid entering the password **every time** when using `sudo`, there are a few options:

---

### üîê Option 1: Use `NOPASSWD` in sudoers file (Recommended)

This method allows specific commands or all sudo commands to be run without a password.

#### Steps:

1. **Open the sudoers file with `visudo`:**
   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. **Add this line at the end of the file to allow your user to run all sudo commands without a password:**
   ```
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual username.

3. **Save and exit**:
   - If using `nano`, press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`.
   - If using `vi/vim`, press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and press Enter.

> ‚úÖ This is secure as long as you trust the user not to abuse elevated privileges.

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Run `sudo -i` once and keep the session open

If you're running multiple commands, you can switch to root once and reuse the session:

```bash
sudo -i
```

After entering your password once, you‚Äôll be in a root shell and won‚Äôt be prompted again until the sudo timeout ends (default is 5 minutes).

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Option 3: Change sudo password timeout

You can increase the sudo authentication timeout so you don't have to re-authenticate often.

1. Edit the sudoers file:
   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. Add or modify this line:
   ```
   Defaults timestamp_timeout=60
   ```

   This sets the sudo timeout to 60 minutes. Set to `-1` to never expire (not recommended for security).

---

### ‚ùå Not Recommended: Remove sudo entirely

Avoid disabling `sudo` altogether or setting an empty password unless you're in a very controlled environment (like a Docker container). It's a major security risk on production or shared systems.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice Summary

- For **specific commands**: Use `NOPASSWD` only for those commands.
- For **personal/local machines**: Setting `NOPASSWD: ALL` might be acceptable.
- For **servers or shared systems**: Avoid removing password prompts for sudo unless absolutely necessary.
